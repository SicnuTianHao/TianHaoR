Title: Test of the mean and covariance of a multivariate normal
        population,A method for calculating principal component score
        in principal component analysis and factor score in factor
        analysis

Description: The original R package does not contain a variety of tests for multivariate normal population, while the test method given in the multivariate statistical analysis has been implemented in the TianHaoR package to test the mean value and covariance of multivariate normal population,At the same time, we provide a direct method to calculate the principal component score in principal component analysis and factor score in factor analysis
